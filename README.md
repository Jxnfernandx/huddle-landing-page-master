## My process

I started my process by setting up all the elements on HTML first. Making sure all the images and SVG's were visible. I then went ahead and worked on the CSS, while also switching between screen sizes to make sure my code was compatible on smaller screens. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Being my first Junior level challenge, this landing page took a while to get the basic layout together. After a few tries and a few days, I was able to complete the task and come up with a few solutions that ultimately let me finish the project and let me replicate it as close as possible. 
I mostly struggled with the container that is in the middle of the page, for I didnt know if I should've flexbox on the whole page or not to center it.
Another struggle I had was getting the logo to turn white instead of green. The SVGs were also new and a bit of a struggle



### Continued development

I feel like finishing this project significally helped my flexbox skills. I am looking forward to working on more projects like this in the future, while also adding grid to my arsenal.


### Useful resources

- [Open AI](https://chat.openai.com) - I used ChatGPT to help me analyze my code and let me know if I was practicing good coding practices.
- [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org) - I will always recommend MDN to anyone who needs a reference on HTML/CSS/Javascript best practices.
